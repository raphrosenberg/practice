    <string name="bio">Hi, my name is Bender.
        \n\nI love fish, shrimp and lobster.
        \n\nThe kind that is alive and swims around in an aquarium or river, or a lake, and definitely the ocean.
        \nFun fact is that I have several balls and carry them around with me wherever I go.
        \n\nI like eating fish, too. Raw fish. Grilled fish. Smoked fish. Poached fish - not so much.
        \n\nOne time I went to Maine and ate fresh lobster.
        \nI ran around like a crazy dog and ever since it\'s been my favorite.
        \n\nOnce, when I was vacationing in Canada, and very hungry, I got lost with my pop.
        \nWe walked around trying to read French street signs until like magic we made it back to the apartment.
        \n\nI heard, if you give a chihuahua enough sunlight he\'ll turn into a sunflower.
        \nOr maybe just a dog with a pink belly.
        \n\nMy favorite thing in the world after sunglight and fish is probably kisses.
        \nKisses are quite wonderful, they make me smile in my own dog fashion.
        \n\nI also have a brother who\'s name is Olaf. He\'s ok.
        \nEven though he tries to steal my dinner sometimes I like to snuggle with him afterwards.
        \n\n</string>
